### **Scenario 1: High Availability for a Web Application**  
**Question:** You have a web application hosted on a **single Azure Virtual Machine**. Your company wants to ensure high availability and automatic scaling. What solution would you recommend?  

**Answer:**  
- Deploy the web application in an **Azure Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS)** to automatically scale instances based on demand.  
- Use an **Azure Load Balancer** to distribute incoming traffic across multiple VM instances.  
- Store session state externally using **Azure Cache for Redis** or **Azure SQL Database** to avoid session loss during scaling.  
- Consider moving to **Azure App Service** if full VM control is not required, as it provides built-in scaling and high availability.

### **Scenario 2: Securing Sensitive Data in Azure Storage**  
**Question:** Your application stores sensitive customer data in **Azure Blob Storage**. How would you ensure security and prevent unauthorized access?  

**Answer:**  
- **Use Private Endpoints** to restrict access to your storage account from selected virtual networks.  
- **Enable Azure Storage Encryption** with **Microsoft-managed or customer-managed keys** (CMK).  
- **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** to limit access to authorized users.  
- **Use Shared Access Signatures (SAS)** to provide time-limited access to resources.  
- **Enable Advanced Threat Protection** to detect unusual access patterns.

### **Scenario 3: Disaster Recovery for an Azure SQL Database**  
**Question:** Your company wants to ensure that an **Azure SQL Database** is available even if the primary region fails. What disaster recovery strategy would you implement?  

**Answer:**  
- **Use Geo-Replication** (Active Geo-Replication) to replicate the database to another region.  
- **Enable Auto-Failover Groups** to automatically switch to the secondary database if the primary fails.  
- **Regularly test failover** to ensure minimal downtime during disasters.  
- **Back up the database** using Azure SQL automated backups with **Long-Term Retention (LTR)**.

### **Scenario 4: Cost Optimization for a Development Environment**  
**Question:** Your company runs a **development and testing environment** in Azure, but costs are getting high. How can you optimize costs?  

**Answer:**  
- **Use Azure Dev/Test Pricing** â€“ Discounts are available for non-production workloads.  
- **Use Auto-Shutdown on VMs** to turn off machines when not in use.  
- **Move workloads to Azure Spot VMs** for cost savings if downtime is acceptable.  
- **Use Azure Reservations** to commit to 1-year or 3-year plans for consistent workloads.  
- **Monitor resource usage** with **Azure Cost Management** to identify and remove unused resources.

### **Scenario 5: Managing Hybrid Cloud Connectivity**  
**Question:** Your company has an on-premises data center and wants to extend its network to Azure securely. What solutions would you recommend?  

**Answer:**  
- **Azure VPN Gateway** â€“ If low-to-moderate bandwidth is needed, set up a **Site-to-Site VPN** for secure connectivity.  
- **Azure ExpressRoute** â€“ If high-speed, dedicated, and private connectivity is required.  
- **Azure Virtual WAN** â€“ If multiple branch offices need to connect securely to Azure.  
- **Hybrid Identity** â€“ Use **Azure AD Connect** to sync identities for seamless authentication.  

---

### **Scenario 6: Implementing a Serverless Solution**  
**Question:** Your application needs to process **millions of messages per day** with unpredictable traffic spikes. How would you design a scalable and cost-efficient solution?  

**Answer:**  
- Use **Azure Functions** to process messages in a **serverless** manner, scaling automatically.  
- Store messages in **Azure Queue Storage** or **Azure Event Hub** to handle spikes.  
- Use **Azure Logic Apps** or **Durable Functions** if workflows require orchestration.  
- Optimize performance by choosing the **Consumption Plan** (pay-per-execution) instead of a fixed App Service Plan.  

---

### **Scenario 7: Migrating On-Premises Workloads to Azure**  
**Question:** Your company wants to migrate **on-premises VMs and databases** to Azure with minimal downtime. What approach would you take?  

**Answer:**  
- Use **Azure Migrate** to assess workloads and plan migration.  
- For VMs, use **Azure Site Recovery (ASR)** for replication and failover with minimal downtime.  
- For databases, use **Azure Database Migration Service** to move SQL Server, MySQL, or PostgreSQL to Azure SQL.  
- Test the migration in a **staging environment** before the final cutover.  

---

### **Scenario 8: Monitoring and Logging in Azure**  
**Question:** Your company is experiencing performance issues with an application hosted in Azure. How would you diagnose and monitor the issue?  

**Answer:**  
- Use **Azure Monitor** to track performance metrics and logs.  
- Enable **Application Insights** for deep application-level telemetry.  
- Check logs using **Azure Log Analytics** to identify bottlenecks.  
- Set up **Azure Alerts** to notify teams about performance degradation.  
- Use **Azure Service Health** to check for any Azure outages impacting services.  

---

### **Scenario 9: Implementing Zero Trust Security in Azure**  
**Question:** Your organization is adopting a **Zero Trust** security model. How would you implement this in Azure?  

**Answer:**  
- Use **Azure AD Conditional Access** to enforce policies based on risk.  
- Require **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** for all users.  
- Implement **Just-In-Time (JIT) access** for VMs using Azure Security Center.  
- Restrict access using **Azure Privileged Identity Management (PIM)**.  
- Use **Microsoft Defender for Cloud** for continuous security monitoring.  

---

### **Scenario 10: Managing Multi-Region Deployment**  
**Question:** You need to deploy an application across multiple Azure regions for **low latency and high availability**. How would you achieve this?  

**Answer:**  
- Deploy the application in **multiple Azure regions**.  
- Use **Azure Traffic Manager** to route users to the closest region based on performance.  
- Set up **Geo-Replication for databases** (e.g., Azure SQL, Cosmos DB).  
- Use **Azure Front Door** for global load balancing and security.  
- Ensure **automated failover** in case of regional failures.
